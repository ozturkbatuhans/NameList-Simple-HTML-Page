# NameList-Simple-HTML-Page

This project is one of my first web pages created using basic HTML and JavaScript. It features a simple input form and a button to add names to a list. I wanted to upload this project to GitHub to share my work and track my progress.

Features

Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Allows users to enter a name and add it to a list.

Provides an alert if the input field is empty.

Usage

Open the page in a web browser.

Enter a name in the input field.

Click the "Voeg naam toe" button to add the name to the list.

Future Improvements

Add localStorage support to save the list in the browser.

Implement a feature to remove list items.

Improve the design and styling.

This project helped me understand basic JavaScript and DOM manipulation. I will continue learning and making improvements!
